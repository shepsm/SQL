#I've downloaded a digital media store database called Chinook and answered the following questions.

#Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 
SELECT FirstName,LastName,CustomerID,Country FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country<>"USA";

#Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT FirstName,LastName,CustomerID,Country FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country="Brazil";

#Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT c.FirstName,c.LastName,i.InvoiceID,i.InvoiceDate,i.BillingCountry FROM chinook.customers c
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.customerID=i.customerID
WHERE i.Country="Brazil";

#Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT FirstName,LastName,Title FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title LIKE "Sales Support Agent";

#Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
Select Distinct BillingCountry FROM chinook.invoices
ORDER BY BillingCountry asc;

#Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT i.invoiceId,e.FirstName,e.LastName FROM chinook.customers c
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON i.CustomerId=c.CustomerId
JOIN chinook.employees e

#Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

JOIN chinook.employees e
ON e.EmployeeID=c.SupportRepId;

#How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT InvoiceId) FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE "2009%";

#What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(Total) FROM chinook.invoices

#Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID. (I decided a left join made more sense in case there were any missing tracts in the tracks table)
SELECT i.invoiceId,i.InvoiceLineId,t.Name FROM chinook.invoice_items i
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t
ON t.TrackId=i.TrackID;

Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT i.invoiceId,i.InvoiceLineId,t.Name AS SongName,art.Name As Artist_Name FROM chinook.invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.tracks t

#Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
