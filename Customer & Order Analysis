#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1 How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE orderID<>'Order ID' AND length(orderID)=6;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID), Product FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE orderID<>'Order ID' AND length(orderID)=6 
AND Product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct c.acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers c
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales f
ON f.orderID=c.order_id
WHERE f.orderID<>'Order ID' AND length(f.orderID)=6;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct product, price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY Price asc
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(Quantity)*price AS "Revenue", Product FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product,COUNT(Product) AS "#Sold", location, sum(Quantity)*price AS "Revenue" FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101' 
Group By Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(distinct c.acctnum),c.acctnum AS "Cust#", AVG(f.price*f.Quantity) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales f
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers c
ON f.orderID=c.order_id
WHERE f.Quantity>2
And orderID<>'Order ID' AND length(orderID)=6;

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT sum(Quantity),Product FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;
