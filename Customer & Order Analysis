#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct c.acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers c

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct product, price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY Price asc

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(Quantity)*price AS "Revenue", Product FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(distinct c.acctnum),c.acctnum AS "Cust#", AVG(f.price*f.Quantity) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales f
