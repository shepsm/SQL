/In these queries I'm solving a mystery. First, I need to find the right crime scene report. I know the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and 
that it took place in ​SQL City​. Then I need to solve it./

/first, I found the name of available tables/
SELECT name 
FROM sqlite_master
where type = 'table';
 
 /Then, I ran the following for each table (truncated to one table here) to find the structure of each table/
 SELECT sql 
 FROM sqlite_master
 where name = 'interview'
 
 /I ran this query to find all murders in SQL City. I did not specify which date so I could find the formatting of the integer. The resulting table had 3 murders committed
 in 2018 and only one on Jan 15,2018, so I didn't need to further refine/
SELECT date,type,description,city FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE city LIKE "SQL City"
AND type LIKE "Murder";

/finding the first witness at the last house on Northwestern Dr/
SELECT id, name, license_id, address_number, address_street_name,ssn FROM person
WHERE address_street_name LIKE "Northwestern Dr%"
ORDER BY address_number desc;

/finding the second witness 'Anabelle' on Franklin/
SELECT id, name, license_id, address_number, address_street_name,ssn FROM person
WHERE address_street_name LIKE "Franklin Ave%"
AND name LIKE "%Annabel%";

 /getting interview transcripts from the 2 witnesses/
 SELECT p.name,i.transcript FROM interview i
INNER JOIN person p
ON i.person_id=p.id

AND ci.check_in_date = 20180109;

/seeing if either suspect from prior query has an interview. Only one does./
SELECT i.person_id,p.name, i.transcript FROM interview i
JOIN person p
ON i.person_id=p.id
WHERE i.person_id=28819
OR i.person_id=67318;

/based on prior interview, narrowed down suspect again. 3 remain./
